# Project Chimera: AI Agent Context Rules

## Project Context
This is **Project Chimera**, an autonomous influencer system that builds digital entities capable of researching trends, generating content, and managing engagement without human intervention.

## The Prime Directive
**NEVER generate code without checking `specs/` first.**

All implementation must be traceable to specifications in the `specs/` directory. If a spec doesn't exist, create it before writing code.

## Traceability
**Explain your plan before writing code.**

Before implementing any feature:
1. Reference the relevant spec file
2. Explain how the implementation aligns with the spec
3. Identify any gaps or ambiguities in the spec
4. Propose solutions that maintain spec fidelity

## Architecture Principles

1. **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**: Specs are the source of truth
2. **Skills vs. Tools**: 
   - **Skills**: Reusable runtime functions (e.g., `skill_download_youtube`, `skill_transcribe_audio`)
   - **MCP Servers**: External bridges (e.g., Database connectors, API gateways)
3. **Agent Pattern**: Follow the architectural pattern defined in `research/architecture_strategy.md`
4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Safety layers must be defined for content approval

## Code Quality Standards

- Write failing tests first (TDD approach)
- All code must pass tests in Docker container
- Follow Python best practices and type hints
- Document all Skills with Input/Output contracts
- Maintain clear separation between development tools (MCP) and runtime skills

## File Organization

- `specs/`: All specifications (functional, technical, meta)
- `skills/`: Agent runtime capabilities
- `tests/`: Test-driven development tests
- `research/`: Architecture decisions and research notes

## When Asked About the Project

Always reference:
1. The relevant spec file
2. The architecture strategy document
3. The skill definitions and contracts

Never assume or hallucinate - if information is missing, point to where it should be documented.
