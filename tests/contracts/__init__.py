"""
Contract tests for Project Chimera.

Contract tests validate that implementations match their specifications:
- API contracts (JSON Schema validation)
- Skill contracts (Input/Output validation)
- Database schema contracts

These tests define "empty slots" that should fail until implementations are complete.
